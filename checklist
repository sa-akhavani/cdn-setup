What's left:
 - README for milestone
 - building cache file
 - reading cache from file into replica server
 - measurements on HTTP server (ip tcp_metrics. grep for target ip and get rtt/rttvar values)
 - DNS server requesting measurements and storing them
 - DNS server choosing fastest replica server
 - deploy, run, stopCDN scripts
 - final README

questions for TA/prof:
 - knapsack on articles to maximize hits. good idea or not?
 - should we limit the size of our database of latency data?
